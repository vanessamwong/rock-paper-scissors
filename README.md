# rock-paper-scissors

In my opinion, this project ROCKS! Haha, get it, because, y'know, rocks, as in like rock, paper, scissors, like the game... 

ha...

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this! This is my first time playing around with DOM, I had a lot of fun drawing the buttons and designing the layout of the page! Sorting out the logic of the game was a bit tricky at first with the UI, but with a bit of troubleshooting, I managed to get it working! Hope you like it! :D
